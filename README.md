# Hydra â€“ DDoS / DoS Testing Tool

> **Status:** ðŸš§ Under development

Hydra is a **Go-based security testing utility** for simulating Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack scenarios in **authorized environments**.  It provides a **REST API** and **web interface** for starting/stopping simulated attacks, monitoring status, and testing application/network resilience.

âš  **Disclaimer:**
This tool is intended **only for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes**.
Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal.
The author assumes **no responsibility** for misuse.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Start/Stop Attacks** via REST API.
* **Live Monitoring** of:
  * Attack status (running/idle)
  * Total requests sent
  * Target URL
  * Workers (concurrent requests)
  * POST payload size
* **Web UI** for control and monitoring.
* **Configurable Parameters**:
  * Target URL
  * Number of workers
  * POST data size
* **Security Controls**:
  * API key authentication
  * Rate limiting
  * HTTPS support
