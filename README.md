# Hydra DoS Attack Tool

NOTE: Under development

This is a Go application that simulates a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack tool. It allows you to launch attacks, stop them, and monitor their status through a simple API and a web interface.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical. The developers of this tool are not responsible for any misuse.

## Features

*   Start and stop attacks via an API.
*   Monitor attack status (running, total requests, target URL, workers, post size).
*   Web interface for easy control and monitoring.
*   Configurable attack parameters:
    *   Target URL
    *   Number of workers (concurrent requests)
    *   POST data size
*   Rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
*   HTTPS support for secure communication.
*   API key authentication.
